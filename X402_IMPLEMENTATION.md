# X402 Payment Flow Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the X402 payment flow for CreatorChain, enabling USDC payments on Base network.

## Overview

The X402 payment flow has been integrated into CreatorChain to provide fast, reliable USDC payments on the Base network. This implementation uses wagmi's `useWalletClient` hook combined with a custom X402 payment service.

## Implementation Components

### 1. X402 Payment Service (`lib/x402-payment.ts`)

Core service class that handles:
- USDC contract interactions on Base network
- Payment execution and verification
- Balance checking
- Batch payment processing

**Key Features:**
- Uses Base network USDC contract: `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`
- Supports single and batch payments
- Transaction verification with receipt checking
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

### 2. React Hook (`lib/hooks/useX402Payment.ts`)

Custom React hook that provides:
- Wallet client integration with wagmi
- USDC balance management
- Payment execution methods
- Transaction verification
- Loading states and error handling

**Hook API:**
```typescript
const {
  isReady,           // Boolean: wallet connected and service initialized
  usdcBalance,       // String: current USDC balance
  executePayment,    // Function: execute single payment
  executeBatchPayment, // Function: execute multiple payments
  verifyPayment,     // Function: verify transaction
  loadUSDCBalance    // Function: refresh balance
} = useX402Payment();
```

### 3. Payment Modal (`components/X402PaymentModal.tsx`)

User interface for X402 payments featuring:
- USDC balance display
- Payment amount input with validation
- Real-time payment status tracking
- Individual payment retry functionality
- Distribution preview with platform fees
- Error handling and user feedback

**Features:**
- Shows USDC balance before payment
- Validates sufficient balance
- Processes payments sequentially for each contributor
- Displays payment status with icons (pending, processing, completed, failed)
- Allows retry of failed payments
- Shows transaction hashes for successful payments

### 4. Test Component (`components/X402TestComponent.tsx`)

Development/testing interface that provides:
- Single payment testing
- Transaction verification testing
- Balance checking
- Real-time status updates
- Error debugging information

## Integration Points

### Main Application Integration

The X402 payment flow is integrated into the main CreatorChain application:

1. **Project Details View**: Added "X402 USDC" button alongside existing "Distribute ETH" option
2. **Payment Processing**: Handles successful X402 payments by updating project totals and creating payout records
3. **Transaction Tracking**: Stores actual transaction hashes from X402 payments

### Wagmi Integration

The implementation leverages wagmi's wallet infrastructure:
- `useWalletClient()` for wallet connection and transaction signing
- `useAccount()` for address and connection status
- Base network configuration through wagmi chains

## Usage Flow

### For Users:
1. Connect wallet to the application
2. Navigate to a project's detail page
3. Click "X402 USDC" button
4. Enter distribution amount in USDC
5. Review distribution preview showing:
   - Total amount
   - Platform fee (2%)
   - Individual contributor payouts
6. Execute payment - each contributor receives their share automatically
7. Monitor payment status in real-time
8. Retry any failed payments if needed

### For Developers:
1. Import and use the `useX402Payment` hook
2. Check `isReady` status before allowing payments
3. Call `executePayment` or `executeBatchPayment` as needed
4. Handle success/error states appropriately
5. Use `verifyPayment` to confirm transaction completion

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Wallet Connection**: Validates wallet is connected before payments
- **Balance Validation**: Checks sufficient USDC balance before execution
- **Transaction Failures**: Captures and displays specific error messages
- **Network Issues**: Handles RPC failures and network timeouts
- **Retry Mechanism**: Allows users to retry failed individual payments

## Testing

### Manual Testing
Use the X402TestComponent to test:
- Single payment execution
- Transaction verification
- Balance checking
- Error scenarios

### End-to-End Testing
1. Connect wallet with USDC balance on Base
2. Create a test project with contributors
3. Use X402 payment modal to distribute funds
4. Verify transactions on Base network explorer
5. Confirm contributor balances updated

## Security Considerations

- **Contract Address**: Uses official Base USDC contract
- **Transaction Signing**: All transactions signed by user's wallet
- **No Private Keys**: Implementation never handles private keys
- **Validation**: Input validation prevents invalid transactions
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling prevents crashes

## Network Configuration

- **Chain**: Base (Chain ID: 8453)
- **Token**: USDC (6 decimals)
- **Contract**: `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`
- **RPC**: Uses wagmi's default Base RPC endpoints

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the X402 implementation:

1. **Gas Optimization**: Implement batch transfers using multicall
2. **Transaction Queuing**: Queue payments for better UX during high network congestion
3. **Price Feeds**: Add USD/USDC price conversion for better UX
4. **Payment Scheduling**: Allow scheduled/recurring payments
5. **Multi-token Support**: Extend to support other tokens on Base
6. **Analytics**: Add payment analytics and reporting

## Dependencies

- `wagmi`: Wallet connection and blockchain interactions
- `viem`: Ethereum client library
- `x402-axios`: X402 protocol integration (installed but not directly used in current implementation)
- `@coinbase/onchainkit`: Base network integration

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **"Wallet not connected"**: Ensure wallet is connected and on Base network
2. **"Insufficient balance"**: Check USDC balance is sufficient for payment + gas
3. **"Payment failed"**: Check network connectivity and try again
4. **"Transaction not found"**: Wait for network confirmation, then verify
5. **"Invalid recipient"**: Ensure recipient address is valid Ethereum address

## Support

For issues with the X402 implementation:
1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify wallet connection and network selection
3. Confirm USDC balance and gas availability
4. Use the test component to isolate issues
5. Check Base network status for any outages
